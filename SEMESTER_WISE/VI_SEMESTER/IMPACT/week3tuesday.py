# 37 Mohit has no work to do in the kitchen, so he decided to play a card game with the following rules: Initially, N cards are placed
# in a row on a table. Each card is placed either face up or face down. The goal of the game is to remove all cards from the table, one
# by one. A card may be removed only if it is currently facing up. When a card is removed, its adjacent cards (the cards directly to
# its left and right, if they exist) are flipped, i.e. a card that was facing up will be facing down and vice versa. There is an empty
# space left behind each removed card, i.e. the remaining cards are not moved to create a contiguous row of cards again. Therefore, if
# the game starts with three cards and the middle card is removed, then the cards on the sides are flipped, but removing one of these
# cards afterwards does not cause the other card to be flipped, since it is only adjacent to the empty space created by removing the
# middle card. Determine whether Mohit is able to win this game. 38 Jefecsgn was given a string s of length 8 consisting solely of 'O's
# and '1 is. Assume that the characters of the string are written in a circular fashion. Jeferson need to find the number of 0-1 or 1-0
